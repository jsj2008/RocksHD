                \n Do you have a rock collection? If so, you already know how fascinating rocks can be! This lesson explains how rocks are formed, how they change, and how we use them.
                \n What is a rock?  Rocks are naturally occurring solid combinations of minerals and sometimes other materials too. The common rock granite is made of the minerals quartz, feldspar and biotite. When only one mineral is present, the object is a mineral, not rock.
                \n Scientists classify rocks into three categories: Igneous, Sedimentary, and Metamorphic. These are all part of the rock cycle.
                \n Igneous rocks begin deep in the Earth, which contains solid and molten materials such as silicon, magnesium and iron. Magma bursts through the Earth's surface via volcanoes and cracks in the Earth's crust. At the surface it's called lava. Lava hardens to become new crust.
                \n Rocks are exposed to ocean waves and weather. They slowly break down into pebbles and sand. Sedimentary rocks are made of the resulting sand and mud, material from plants and animals, and minerals left over when liquid evaporates. These all compact and harden to become rock.
                \n Metamorphic rocks are made when rocks experience new temperature and pressure conditions. For example, contact with magma could cause rock to liquify and then recrystallize into a different type of rock.
                \n Scientists believe that humans have been using rocks for about 3.5 million years.  Stone arrowheads were among our first tools. Today we mine rocks for use in roads, statues, buildings, chalkboards, jewelry, cosmetics and many other items.

                <title>Sedimentary rocks</title>
                <text>Sedimentary rocks are formed when layers of sediments: minerals and particles accumulate on top of each other and are transformed by pressure into rock. \n\nOnce the sediments have been formed by weathering and erosion, they are transported and deposited by wind (Aeolian or eolian process) water (fluvial process), glaciers, and ice. \n\nSedimentary rocks are economically valuable compared to other rocks since they are a source of many fossil fuels and ores.\n</text>

                <title>Lava</title>
                <text>Lava is molten rock that comes out of a volcano. After it cools and solidifies it forms igneous rock. \n\nLava can be at very high temperatures ranging from approximately 1290F to over 2190F. \n\nIn this picture, lava flow reaching the ocean is being cooled by the water to form a lava delta. Lava deltas can collapse without warning since they are very unstable. \n\nThe steam produced when the lava and water react is very hot and can contain particles of volcanic rock.\n</text>

                <text>Igneous rocks are formed when lava or magma cool and solidify. \n\nIgneous rocks that form from magma are also known as intrusive or plutonic rocks while those formed from lava are known as extrusive or volcanic rocks. \n\nThere are three types of igneous rocks based on their composition: \n\n 1. Rocks with high amounts of silica and aluminum are known as felsic or silicic. \n\n 2. Rocks with lower amounts of silica and aluminum are known as intermediate or andesitic, \n\n 3. Rocks with high amounts of iron and magnesium are  known as mafic or basaltic \n</text>

                <text>Over 80% of the Earth's volume is in the mantle. \n\nDid you know that the mantle is a rocky shell? \n\nThe upper mantle starts at the base of the crust and extends to about 250 miles. It is made of magnesium and iron silicates such as olivine and pyroxene. \n\nThe upper mantle is rigid on the top and is made of liquid rock below.\n</text>

                <text>This region shows a magmachamber or batholith, which means deep rock. \n\nWhen magma cools deep inside the Earth's crust and transforms into intrusive igneous or plutonic rock in a particular location it forms a batholith. \n\nTypically, batholiths are made of granite or quartz. Sometimes multiple individual rocks can converge to form a large mass of granite rock.\n\nThe Sierra Nevada Batholith that makes up a vast portion of the Sierra Nevada mountains in California is one such example.\n</text>

                <title>Yellowstone</title>
                <text>Yellowstone National Park was established in 1872 as the first National Park in the US. It is located mostly in Wyoming, but extends into Montana and Idaho. \n\nYellowstone derives its name from the Yellowstone River, which in turn gets its name from the yellow colored rocky cliffs on its banks. \n\nFamous for its wildlife, geothermal features, and geology, Yellowstone is also part of the largest volcanic system in North America. \n\nThe Yellowstone Caldera has been termed a stratovolcano because the caldera was formed by large explosive eruptions.\n</text>

                <title>Grand Canyon</title>
                <text>The Grand Canyon National Park represents one of the most complete sequences of rock on Earth. Nearly 40 major sedimentary rock layers are exposed in this area and range in age from about 200 million to nearly 2 billion years old. \n\nMost of these rocks were deposited in warm, shallow seas and near ancient sea shores in western North America. Both marine and terrestrial sediments are showcased, including fossilized sand dunes from an extinct desert.\n\nThe first sedimentary layer of rock, the Bass Formation was laid down 1.25 billion years ago. Fossils of Stromatolites or coastal algae are seen preserved in these rocks. \n\nVolcanic activity formed the Cardenas Basalt between 1.25 billion and 1.1 billion years ago. \n\nCoastal and shallow seas formed the Chuar group of rocks between 825 million and 1.1 billion years ago.\n\n Subsequent rock formations indicate a sequence of retreating oceans alternating with a coastal environment.\n </text>

                <text>The Kaibab limestone forms the topmost layer of rock and is the youngest rock found at the Grand Canyon National Park. This layer was formed when the Grand Canyon was a part of a warm, shallow sea with a sandy floor. \n\nBelow the Kaibab, the Toroweap layer is made of the same material as the Kaibab but has a different color and was formed at a different time. \n\nThe Coconino sandstones below the Toroweap layer are made of quartz and were formed from petrified sand dunes during a time when the the area was composed entirely of sand resulting in a desert like environment. \n\nThe red colored cliffs of the Hermit Shale are rich in iron (hence the red color) and were formed when this region was part of a lagoon like environment with many swamps. This layer of rock has a lot of plant fossils.\n</text>

                <text>Granite is a light colored, intrusive, igneous rock consisting of silicate based minerals like quartz, mica and feldspar. It is the most abundant rock in the continental crust. \n\nGranite rocks can get uplifted and exposed on the surface of the earth when the sedimentary rocks covering them are eroded. \n\nGranite is used in a variety of applications since it resists abrasion and weathering, it can be polished, and it can bear a lot of weight.\n</text>

            \n What is a mineral? Minerals such as gold, calcium and sodium are the building blocks of rocks. They are inorganic. That is, although rocks may contain matter from plants and animals, minerals do not. Minerals are purely chemical. They are typically solid at room temperature.
            \n Minerals are made of the elements listed on the Periodic Table. Minerals may consist of just one element, such as gold, or they can be combinations of elements. Quartz, for example, is made of silicon and oxygen.
            \n Scientists classify minerals in several ways. Some categories are color, luster, hardness, specific  gravity, and cleavage or how the mineral breaks. 
            \n When you are identifying minerals, color is helpful but not enough. Many minerals are found in multiple colors. Also, minerals may be impure; extra chemicals can change their color. Diamonds are made in every color of the rainbow.
            \n "Luster" describes how a mineral reflects light. Some terms used to describe luster are brilliant, metallic, silky and dull.
            \n Hardness is another way to classify a mineral. Hardness is measured by scratching a mineral. Diamonds are the hardest mineral on earth; they can scratch anything.
            \n Specific gravity refers to density. Two mineral chunks of the same size can have different weights. Specific gravity can be measured by comparing a mineral's weight to an equal volume of water.
            \n Cleavage and other characteristics of breakage help people classify minerals. For example, some crystals break with jagged edges. Others break along smooth planes.

                <text>The Kalgoorlie Super Pit or the Fimiston Open Pit is Australia's largest open cut gold mine. \n\nOver 80% of the gold in this mine is found in host rocks that are part of what is known as the Golden Mile Dolerite or the richest mile on Earth. \n\nEvery year over 85 million tons of materials is moved from the pit of which 12 million tons is material that has gold.\n</text>

                <text>Ruby is found mostly embedded in marble.\n\nFirst limestone needs to metamorphose into marble.\n\nSubsequently, as molten granite pushes its way into the marble, it removes silica and leaves behind aluminum and oxygen that form the ruby.\n\nDid you know that ruby formation has been associated with the formation of the Himalayas. Most of the world's rubies are found in areas near the Himalayas.\n</text>

            \n Soil is like a nutrition bar for plants. It holds all the nutrients that plants need to survive. Soil has developed over hundreds of millions of years. It is created as weather erodes rocks and when plants and animals leave material behind. Minerals mix with organic material and water to become soil.
            \n Much of soil is alive! Bacteria, algae and fungi in soil break material into useful nutrients. They make it possible for larger life forms to survive.
            \n The Earth's soil is organized into several layers called horizons. The topmost layer contains humus, which is leaf litter and decomposed organic matter. The next layer is topsoil. This is where seeds germinate and roots grow. It has sediment from rocks and contains some humus too.
            \n The next layer down is called the eluviation layer. It is light colored, made mostly of sand and silt. Most minerals and clay drip down to the subsoil below. Subsoil is rich with clay and minerals from water, such as iron and calcium carbonate.
            \n The bottommost layers are rocky. First there is regolith. Regolith is a mix of broken bedrock and dark soil, which is composed of dead organic matter. A solid layer of bedrock lays beneath it all.
            \n Erosion is the carrying away of rocks and soil. Erosion is caused by wind, precipitation and gravity. Although erosion is a natural process, it is problematic when we lose soil for crops, forests and other habitats. Trees can help fight erosion because their roots stabilize the soil.

                <text>Like earthworms on farmland, termites aerate the surrounding soil, allowing more water to penetrate. \n\nThis activity, along with termite droppings, creates highly fertile patches of earth with a higher percentage of nitrogen and phosphorous than the ground farther away. \n\nThe termite mounds thus have been shown to sustain significantly more shrubs, fruit-bearing trees, bugs, and animals in the African savanna. \n</text>

                <text>Arches National Park was formed over an underground salt bed known as the Paradox formation. \n\nLayers of sediments were deposited onto this salt bed over millions of years and were converted into rock. \n\nAs the salt bed buckled due to the weight of the sandstones, it led to the formation of domes and cavities. \n\nSubsequently, weathering and erosion of these rocks due to water, ice, and wind lead to the formation of some of the magnificent structures seen at the Arches National Park.\n</text>

                <title>Erosion by water</title>
                <text>There are different ways water can erode the landscape. \n\nIn sheet erosion particles loosened by rain splash are transported by flow of water. \n\nIf the erosion happens due to flowing rivulets, it is known as Rill erosion.\n\nLarge channels of water can cause Gully erosion.\n\n Rivers, streams and waves can also cause erosion.\n</text>

                <title>Glaciers</title>
                <text>Glaciers are frozen rivers of ice and sediments that flow downhill. \n\nAs snow falls, it compresses the layers below to form ice. If the ice is formed on a slope, then this massive sheet of ice and snow begins to slowly move downhill. \n\nMost glaciers are found near the poles but they also exits on all the continents.\n</text>

                <title>Glacial erosion</title>
                <text>When glaciers flow over rocks, the ice and sediments in the glacier can act as a sandpaper and pulverize the rock below. This process is known as abrasion. \n\nAbrasion can lead to the formation of deep valleys and mountain slopes. \n\nGlaciers can also soften and remove blocks of rock. This happens because the water in the glacier can penetrate cracks in the rock.\n\nAs the water freezes, it expands leading to a fracture in the rock.\n</text>

                \n Fossils are remains and signs of ancient living things. They are the only evidence we have that certain species existed. Fossils reveal a history of the Earth's earliest bacteria, flowers, fish and other life.
                \n Not everything that dies becomes a fossil; most plants and animals are soon recycled by nature. But sometimes life is preserved in its entirety as a whole fossil. For a whole fossil to occur, a creature must be buried away from all oxygen. This might happen with help from a mudflow, glacier or tree sap.
                \n Compared with whole fossils, cast fossils are more common. Bones, tree trunks and other remains become cast fossils when their organic matter decays and is replaced with minerals. A fossilized bone no longer contains bone material; it has all been replaced! Depending on which minerals fill the mold, a cast fossil may look like dull cement or have spectacular sparkle.
                \n A third type of fossil is the mold fossil.  A mold fossil is an impression of the organism. We know about certain plants and animals simply because of impressions they left.
                \n Finally, a trace fossil is other evidence that an organism existed. Fossilized nests, footprints, and animal dung are examples of trace fossils.
                \n Fossils are constantly weathered or even destroyed by nature. For instance, fossils are lost when rocks undergo metamorphosis. Sometimes though, when erosion and other factors work together, fossils are revealed or become easier to access during geologic expeditions.

                <text>Petrified wood is unique because it is a three dimensional representation of a fossil. \n\nWhen wood is covered with sediment under the ground in an environment without oxygen, it cannot be decomposed.\n\nWater flowing through the sediments can slowly replace the organic materials with minerals. \n\nIt can take over a 100 years to convert wood to petrified wood.\n</text>

                <text>A paleontologist needs a lot of tools to dig out the fossils without damaging them. \n\nTypical tools include chisels, shovels, picks, and brushes. \n\nFirst the fossil is prepared by removing the surrounding rock and debris after excavation. \n\nNext, the fossil is stabilized to ensure that it can be studied and displayed.\n</text>
