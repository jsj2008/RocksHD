	<string>Sprout Labs - Learning Reimagined!\n\nEcosystems HD is a visually engaging and fun exploration of the major biomes of the Earth.\n\nEver wondered why plants and animals have specific adaptations. Why do plants in the rainforest have drip tip leaves? Why do conifers have needle leaves? Why does the jackrabbit have large ears? How has the camel adapted to the desert? What are some adaptations of marine organisms?\n\nThe Ecosystems HD app will be a treat for the curious learner.\n\nPhotos and videos describe the characteristics of the biomes and their inhabitants. The Did You Know section has &quot;WOW&quot; facts related to each biome. The text to speech function allows the text to be narrated.\n\nThe ecosystems matching game is a fun matching game for the various ecosystems and their inhabitants. The quiz is based on Bloom&apos;s taxonomy and is designed to test not only remembering and understanding but also applying, evaluating, and analyzing the concepts.\n\nThe content correlates to State Science Standards in the USA.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Curated photos and videos with descriptive text with free periodic refresh of photos and videos.\n\n- Did You Know section with WOW facts about each topic.\n\n- Easy, Intermediate and Advanced level questions based on Bloom&apos;s Taxonomy to test knowledge about the various topics.\n\n- Fun, matching game refreshed periodically with new content.\n\n\n*****\n\n For more information on news and updates, like us on Facebook and

		<string>Water makes us wonder… Millions of years ago, dinosaurs drank water. </string>
		<string>Are we drinking the same water droplets today? And after raindrops fall, where do they go? </string>
		<string>These and other mysteries are answered by the water cycle. 
</string>
		<string>The water cycle explains how our planet always has the same amount of water.</string>
		<string>This water moves from the ground to the sky and back again, over and over.</string>
		<string>The four stages of the water cycle are called evaporation, condensation, precipitation and runoff.</string>
